Hello,
this is a school projekt four students at Malm√∂ University did for the course Applied Software Architecture. The game is a basic 'last stand' type of game where the player faces off against hordes of zombies with limited supplies. This is our first project in Unity so the quality is undoubtedly mediocre at best but somewhere along the line we appearently learned something related to software architecture.
